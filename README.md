#### Based on the graphs plotted above, here are my key observations:
```
1. Urban areas has highest percentage of total fares, total rides & total fares than Rural & Suburban area types. 
2. The average fare for Rural area is higher than Urban & Suburban area types.
3. Urban area has most number of rides per city & lowest average fare.
```
